It is extremely difficult to remember and maintain multiple credentials (usernames, passwords etc) for various accounts in today's time. 

Often forgetting the passwords and hitting on that forget password button is certainly annoying and time consuming.

Presenting CipherNest -  a locker or a cupboard to shelf your important credentials.

Store your data and get rid of the fear of forgetting it again.

You can edit and delete your data anytime.

And don't worry the credentials are stored on the particular device that you are using (data is securely saved on your device and not over the internet)

Can be used on any device (use it on pc for better experience)
